# My-Data-Science-Curriculum
The path I have taken towards Data Science. 

# Context: My Starting Point

a.) I had a statistical framework for working with data from my energy engineering background at Penn State.

b.) I had a keen eye for business operations due to my entrepreneurship studies in college and Silicon Valley.

c.) My programming skills were my weakest link at this point, having used C# for an introductory course in college and some MatLab.
