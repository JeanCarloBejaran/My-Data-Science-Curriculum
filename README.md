# Context: My Starting Point

**a.)** I had a statistical framework for working with data from my energy engineering background at Penn State.

**b.)** I had a keen eye for business operations due to my entrepreneurship studies in college and Silicon Valley.

**c.)** My programming skills were my weakest link at this point, having used C# for an introductory course in college and some MatLab.
